#Coding Challenge Submission

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
This repository contains my solutions to the coding challenge problems assigned as part of the technical interview round. All programs are implemented in Python and have been thoroughly tested to ensure correctness and clarity.

Files Included

Alien Dictionary.py
Determines the character order from a given sorted list of words in an alien language.

Bitwise Matching Pattern.py
Finds the next larger integer with the same number of binary 1s using bitwise operations.

Knights and Portals.py
Implements a pathfinding algorithm on a grid with knight-like moves and allows one teleport between empty cells.

Matrix Islands with Diagonals.py
Counts the number of islands in a matrix, considering horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections.

Mini Interpreter.py
A simple interpreter that processes variable declarations and conditional if statements from input strings.

sudoku_validator.py
Validates a 9x9 Sudoku board including additional custom zones with the standard Sudoku rules.

Outputs.docx
Contains screenshots showing sample outputs from all programs to demonstrate successful execution and correctness.

# How to Run 
Each solution is contained in its own Python script. You can run any of them using Python 3.x:

python3 <script_name>.py

Please refer to the Outputs.docx file for sample inputs and expected outputs for each problem.
